# LeetCode Solutions with Version Control

This repository showcases my DevOps skills by combining version control with Java programming. Each commit represents a solution to a LeetCode challenge, and this repository is used to practice simple Git commands as I work through each problem.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/LeetCode-Solutions-Version-Control.git
    ```

2. For each LeetCode problem I solve, I delete and update the `src/Solution.java` file to contain my new solution.

3. Commit your changes for each challenge completed:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed [Problem Name]"
    git push origin main
    ```

4. Every commit will reflect a new challenge solved, showcasing both my problem-solving skills in Java and my ability to use Git version control to track changes.

## Example of a Commit

Commit message: `Completed Two Sum Problem`

The Java solution for the Two Sum problem is written in the `src/Solution.java` file.
